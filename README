This is "libusdt", an extraction into a C library of the common parts
of ruby-dtrace[1], perl-dtrace[2] and node-dtrace-provider[3].

Once this library is functional, those libraries will become bindings
to this library, rather than containing their own implementations of
DOF and probe creation. Other dynamic language bindings should follow.
